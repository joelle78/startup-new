                    <p><span> At Verve, we want to realize the potential of our ambitious international clients - and we‚Äôd like to do that alongside nice, talented people like you. Together we‚Äôll create amazing work that you can be truly proud of while enjoying the best days of your career.  </span>

                    <p> We are brand strategists and -designers, digital designers, and developers who transform good
                        brands into great ones. We combine our digital-first design mindset with a thorough and resolute
                        brand strategy. And distill a brand's energy into an unforgettable story. Like we do for Miro,
                        Juni, and Flutterwave. </p>

                    <p>
                        You are an experienced brand designer that translates the client's goals into strategic design
                        concepts that connect with their audiences and drive their brand forward. Thanks to your
                        knowledge and experience in digital branding and research, you‚Äôll empower your colleagues in
                        design, strategy, and digital design to create their very best work. You'll work at least three
                        days at one of our studios in Amsterdam or The Hague.
                    </p>

                    <p class="par">
                        You'll create brand identities rooted in brand strategy. You don't believe that a brand is its
                        logo. You create holistic brand systems that live across and adapt to different kinds of media.
                        You pitch and present to clients, you share creative insights in inspiring keynotes. You‚Äôre a
                        creator and confident speaker, with a vision for the future of branding, tech, culture, and
                        design. You evoke a sense of trust and calm within your team and quickly translate trends in the
                        world into great strategic ideas and striking visuals. With your positive and proactive
                        attitude, you turn every project into collective success.
